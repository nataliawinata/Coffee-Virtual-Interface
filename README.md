## 📌 Background

Traditional coffee machines often rely on physical buttons or touchscreens as user interfaces. While effective, these methods raise concerns about hygiene and user experience—particularly in public places like cafés or restaurants. Touch-based systems can transmit germs and may overwhelm users with too many options.

This project introduces a **contactless virtual coffee ordering interface** using **hand gesture recognition** powered by **MediaPipe Hands** and **CVZone**. Users can select coffee and pastry packages with simple hand movements in front of a webcam—no physical touch required.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Build a gesture-based coffee ordering system using a webcam.
- Detect finger gestures in real time with **MediaPipe Hands**.
- Implement an intuitive menu navigation based on gesture sequences.

---

## ❓ Problem Statements

- How to create a virtual interface that recognizes hand gestures via camera?
- How to design gesture-based menu navigation with proper sequence control?

---

## ✅ Benefits

- Improves hygiene through touchless interaction.
- Introduces a more natural and intuitive user experience.
- Opens new possibilities in vending, food service, and public digital interfaces.
